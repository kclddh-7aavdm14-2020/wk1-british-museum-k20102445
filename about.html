            <p>Hi!</p>
            <p>I am Yi Qing. You can call me Felicity. I am currently in Zhejiang, China. I graduated from University of Nottingham Ningbo China studying Finance, Accounting and Management.</p>
            <p>My favorite exhibition comes from Nanjing Museum. It is called Exhibition of the Customs of the Republic of China. The exhibition hall is an epitome of the old Nanjing city culture by imitating the street view of European architecture in the Republic of China. The sky, roads, streetlights and ancillary facilities are simulated and reproduced with sound, light and electricity technology to create a real historical scene. It seems like i can cross the barrier of time and space, and walking on the real streets of the Republic of China.</p>
            <p>Looking forward to seeing you and starting this course!</p>
