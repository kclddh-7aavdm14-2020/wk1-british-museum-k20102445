<p>I visit the projects in 3D in this British Museum expedition. All the 3D models are displayed on the Sketchfab and it's open for us to download these 3D models.</p>
<p>Among these collections, I like the Sekhmet the most. It is an 18th Dynasty granodiorite statue of Sekhmet, standing, with papyrus-staff before, base and arms missing or damaged. This sculpture is very symbolic in Egypt culture.</p>
<p>Under the Nikon D5100, 337 photographs are taken by Daniel Pett to liven up this 3D model.</p>
